# MagneticForceSimulation
This repository contains a Python code that simulates the magnetic force between two magnets of different sizes and orientations, without using the small magnet approximation. The code uses the FEniCS library to solve for the magnetic field and potential functions for each magnet, and then calculates the magnetic force between the two magnets using those functions. The magnetic field for each magnet is also plotted.

## Installation
To run the code, you will need to install the following packages:
- fenics
- numpy
- matplotlib


## Usage
To use the code, simply run the magnet_simulation.py file and input the dimensions, distance, and angles of the magnets when prompted. The code will then simulate the magnetic force between the magnets and plot the magnetic field for each magnet.

## Contributing
If you would like to contribute to this project, feel free to fork the repository and submit a pull request.
